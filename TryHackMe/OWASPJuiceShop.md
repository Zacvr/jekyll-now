LETS GET SOME JUICE!
----

First lets find the correct IP

```nmap -n -sn 10.10.175.0-255```

Since we know this is a website we can test all of our choices that have ports 80 & 443

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/IPs.PNG">

Since 10.10.175.250 ONLY has HTTP lets try that in a browser

And for myself at least that was correct!

TASK 2
----

All of these answers are shown in THM

Question 1
***admin@juice-sh.op***

Question 2
***q***

Question 3
***Star Trek***

TASK 3
----

Looks like we need to break into the admin account

lets click on the "Account" button in the top right

Click "Login"

Lets type in some information for the username and password

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Admin.PNG">

Now lets change the email from "zac" to

```' or 1=1--```

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/AdminPass.PNG">

Question 1
***32a5e0f21372bcc1000a6088b93b458e41f0e02a***

Alright now we need to get into Benders account

Lets go back to the login page and put

```bender@juice-sh.op'--``` as the email and anything for a password

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Bender.PNG">

Success! we did not even need to intercept the package since the email is valid and "--" will bypass the login system

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/BenderPass.PNG">


We got in!


<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Admin-Done.PNG">

**fb364762a3c102b2db932069c0e6b78e738d4066**


TASK 4
---

Now we need to use some brute forcing

First lets logout

Now lets put 

```admin@juice-sh.op```

as the email

Click "Action" and the "Send To Intruder"

Lets click on Intruder next to Proxy in Burpsuite

We are told to click "Clear ยง"

then click "Add ยง" twice inside of the password

Now lets click Payloads and load the requested payload

I had to install Seclists with

```sudo apt-get install seclists``` on my VM

After it is loaded lets click "Start attack"

Due to the demo version of Intruder it took awhile for me to find the correct password

"admin123" is the correct password (I should have guessed..)

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Admin123.PNG">

Now we have the answer to Question 1

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/PasswordStrength.PNG">

**c2110d06dc6f81c67cd8099ff0ba601241f1ac0e**

Now we need to try and reset the password for "jim@juice-sh.op"

For our secuirty question wejust need to find it from the information provided in THM

It is most likely

```Samuel```

Lets try to set a new password

I set it to "12345"

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/JimPass.PNG">

We now have the answer to Question 2!

**094fbc9b48e525150ba97d05b942bbf114987257**

Time for 

TASK 5
---

If we try to go to the IP/ftp we see it is no protected

Lets download the "acquisitions.md" for the flag

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Acquisitions.PNG">

We now have the answer it Question # 1

**edf9281222395a1c5fee9b89e32175f1ccf50c5b**

For # 2 we know most of it

Lets login to the account

Email   : mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op
Password: Mr.N00dles

Noodles helped us answer the question!

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/SafeSearch.PNG">

**66bdcffad9e698fd534003fbb3cc7e2b7b55d7f0**

We now need to go back to that FTP folder

But if we try to download the file it will give a 403 error

We can now play with a poison null byte (%2500)

Lets try a url

```10.10.175.250/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md```

If it was successful we can download the file and see our answer to # 3

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/NullByte.PNG">

**bfc1e6b4a16579e85e06fee4c36ff8c02fb13795**

Now onto

TASK 6
---

Now we get to inspect the website a bit!

I am using Firefox so I will use the debugger

We must got to 

"main-es2015.js in the debugger

We need to make this legible by clicking the {} at the bottom

Now if we press "Ctrl+F" we can search for "Admin"

After we findout about the possible page we need to login to

admin@juice-sh.op (which we previously learned has "admin123" as a password) to see the page

after we login we will see the page again

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/AdminSection.PNG">

The answer to #1 is

**946a799363226a24822008503f5d1324536629a0**

For Question #2 lets do a few basic things

On the GET we need to change /rest/basket1 into

```/rest/basket/2```

After we forward the packets we will since a different cart!

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Shopping.PNG">

We already have the answer to # 2 now

**41b997a36cc33fbe4f0ba018474e19ae5ce52121**


For # 3 who even believes in 5-star reviews? Not I!

If we go into the administration panel we can delete the reviews

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/5Star.PNG">

Well that was to easy...

Time for TASK 7!
---

We need to try a DOM XSS for Question # 1

If we go to the search bar and type

```<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"> ```

We will get our answer!

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/DOMXSS.PNG">

**9aaf4bbea5c30d00a1f5bbcfce4db6d4b0efe0bf**

Now onto question # 2

Login to the Admin account if you are not already in it

Click Account > Privacy & Security > Last Login IP

make sure the intercept is on and logout 

inside of Burpsuite we will click Headers and we are going to add a new header

after typing in

It should show    True-Client-IP   | <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
  
After forwarding the frames I had to go back to the last login IP to get the popup

and I had to do the above twice to get the answer to # 2

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Login.PNG">

**149aa8ce13d7a4a8a931472308e269c94dc5f156**

Time for Question # 3

Agfain we will use the admin account but we need to go to the "Order History" page

We will click on any Orders tracking page (click the truck icon)

Once there we will change the URL

it should look similar to this

"http://10.10.175.250/#/track-result?id=5267-8fcfc2a4fc22eeb5"

we will change it to look like this

"http://10.10.175.250/#/track-result?id=<iframe src%3D"javascript:alert(`xss`)">"

now we need to refresh the page and we got our answer to # 3!

<img src="/images/TryHackMe/OWASPJuiceShop/Tracking.PNG">
