Our speaker will be

***Zac Van Roekel***

with their presentation titled

**Cracking The Ciphers**


Some people believe it to be gibberish or a foreign language, in some ways it is! 
Today we will go over the basics of Cryptography and Ciphers to allow us to learn a few new ways of not only seeing but understanding these strange symbols and strings of text and what they may be using to hide the truth that lies beneath the text.


I am an up-and-comer in the field of Ciphers as well as Cryptography overall. It began as a simple assignment as has spiraled into a love for the language that most would call ciphers.


We will be going over how ciphers began and their uses throughout our existence as well as the basics of string ciphers such as ROT13, A1Z26, Base64, CharCode, & the Cesar cipher. Symbol ciphers such as PigPen, Tic-Tac-Toc, and even the infamous Zodiac Killer Cipher!


This will be a fresh & unreleased submission MiroCon will be the first conference for it to be released to


I have never done presentations to more than a class I was in or very small ones for my Community College
